
Changes in Version 1.0.0

	o The quantspec package was conceptually remodeled. It is now based on an
		object-oriented design. The implementation uses the S4 system.
	o The functionality was largely extended and now includes:
		-	efficient computation of frequency representations based on
			(1) the clipped time series,
			(2) the quantile regression estimator in the harmonic linear model.
		- computation of the periodograms based on (1) and (2)
		- computation of smoothed periodograms; using different types of weights
			will yield estimatiors for
			(1) the Laplace or copula spectral density
			(2) the integrated Laplace or copula spectral density
		- simulation of
			(1) Laplace and copula spectral densities,
			(2) integrated Laplace and copula spectral densities,
		- a mechanism to generate block bootstrap replicates in the time domain and
			compute all the estimators from them.


Version 0.1 and 0.2

	o Three functions to compute, smooth and plot the (quantile regression-based)
		Laplace periodograms and rank-based Laplace periodograms.
